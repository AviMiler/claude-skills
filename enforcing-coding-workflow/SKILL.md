  Enforces a mandatory 5-stage sequence (spec-validate → build → verify → 
  document → git) for every coding task in every project. Spec-driven approach:
  validates all work against project spec, updates spec during development as
  requirements emerge, asks user to confirm new requirements before adding to
  spec, and verifies all work aligns with spec without regression. Applies
  whenever a request results in code changes. Use when the user asks to build,
  add, implement, fix, or refactor code.

# Coding Workflow

⚠️ Read First — also load `anthropic-skills:agentic-code` for tracking-file
templates and code quality rules used in Stage 4.

## Core Rule

Every coding task goes through all 5 stages, in order, every time. **The spec
is the single source of truth** — all work must align with it, and the spec
must be kept up-to-date as requirements emerge. Never skip a stage or the spec
check.

```
1. SPEC-VALIDATE  →  2. BUILD  →  3. VERIFY  →  4. DOCUMENT  →  5. GIT
```

If a stage fails, stop and resolve it before moving on. The spec may change
during development (Stage 2); when it does, return to Stage 1 to re-validate.

## When This Applies

Any request that changes code: features, bug fixes, refactors, config or
dependency changes — including ones that sound small ("rename this variable,"
"fix this typo").

Does NOT apply to: pure Q&A, read-only code review, exploration, or
non-code tasks (standalone doc writing, etc.).

## The 5 Stages

### Stage 1 — Spec-Validate

**The spec is authoritative.** Check the request against it:

- If a spec file exists (spec.md, requirements.md, ARCHITECTURE.md), read it
  fully before responding. This is mandatory.
- If no spec file exists, create one (use existing docs like README,
  AGENT_CONTEXT.md, ARCHITECTURE.md as the de facto spec, then write it down).
- Confirm the request aligns with the spec. If unclear:
  - **Ask the user:** "Does this requirement belong in the spec as a permanent
    requirement, or is it a one-time exception?"
  - If permanent → update the spec document with the user's confirmation
  - If exception → proceed with a clear note that this breaks the spec
  - If conflict → stop and ask how to resolve

**Output of Stage 1:** State what will be built, which spec requirements
apply, and any new requirements that need spec approval before moving to
Stage 2.

### Stage 2 — Build

Implement the change:

- Follow the code quality rules from `anthropic-skills:agentic-code` (file size,
  naming, typing, error handling, no dead abstractions).
- Keep the change scoped to what Stage 1 validated — no drive-by refactors.
- **If new requirements emerge during build:**
  - Pause and ask the user: "A new requirement came up: [X]. Should this be
    added to the spec as a permanent requirement?"
  - If yes → update the spec, then return to Stage 1 to re-validate against
    the updated spec
  - If no → proceed with a note that this is temporary/one-off
- Track every file created, modified, or deleted for Stage 3.

**Output of Stage 2:** Working code that matches the spec, plus a list of
changed files.

### Stage 3 — Verify

**Regression check:** Ensure the build doesn't break existing spec requirements:

- For each requirement in the spec, verify:
  - Still present? (No accidental deletions or overrides)
  - Not degraded? (e.g., performance, security, behavior)
  - New code doesn't contradict it?
- If any requirement is at risk, stop and ask the user:
  - "Does this break [spec requirement]? Should we update the spec or
    change the approach?"
- If spec was updated in Stage 2, verify the new code aligns with the updated
  spec.

**Output of Stage 3:** Go/no-go confirmation that the build is safe and
spec-aligned. If no-go, return to Stage 2.

### Stage 4 — Document

Update the project's tracking files per `anthropic-skills:agentic-code`'s
templates:

```
[ ] AGENT_CONTEXT.md — "Last Changes", "Current State", "Next Steps"
[ ] PROJECT_MAP.md   — any files added/removed/renamed
[ ] CHANGELOG.md     — one line per logical change with date
[ ] spec.md (or similar) — updated requirements/decisions if changed in Stage 2
[ ] ARCHITECTURE.md  — if a pattern or decision changed
[ ] DEPENDENCIES.md  — if a package was added or removed
```

If these files don't exist yet, create them from `anthropic-skills:agentic-code`'s
templates. If time is short, update `AGENT_CONTEXT.md` and the spec at
minimum.

### Stage 5 — Git

- Check for `git-instructions.md` at the project root; if present, follow it
  exactly.
- If absent, ask the user for their git workflow (branching, commit message
  style, auto-push) and write `git-instructions.md` with the answer.
- Stage only the files touched by this task (code + Stage 4 docs) — never a
  blanket `git add -A`.
- Include spec changes in the same commit (spec is code's sibling, not separate).
- Follow the system's destructive-action rules: never force-push, never skip
  hooks, confirm before pushing unless pre-authorized.

## Failure & Restart Handling

- If any stage fails or blocks, stop immediately and report which stage and why.
- Ask the user: retry this stage / adjust the spec (and re-validate) / abort.
- **If spec changes during development (Stage 2), restart from Stage 1** to
  re-validate all requirements against the updated spec before continuing.
- Never drop a stage or the spec check to save time — the user can only
  authorize exceptions explicitly.
